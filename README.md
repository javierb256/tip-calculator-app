## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.
I decided to try out using a mobile first workflow to try out something new when developing this project. While working I found it harder for me to style elements in a desktop view comming from mobile. While I did like the new experience
of working on a mobile first workflow, I prefer working desktop first.

### Useful resources

- [Format Currency](https://www.samanthaming.com/tidbits/30-how-to-format-currency-in-es6/) - This helped me learn how to properly format currencies and other styles that I will use in future projects.
